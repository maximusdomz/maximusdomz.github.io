    <h1>Assignment 2 - Activity 4 Summary</h1>
    <p>
      Wikiversity Activity Name: Configuring the browser settings in Safari. 
      <br>  
      The topic you are describing: Review available resources for Safari and check Safari preferences and/or modify any settings that would improve my experience on using the browser. 
      <br>  
      What you learned about the topic: I learned about the six resources on the Apple Support website. I already knew about the search history and the privacy report resources, but I didn't know much about the option to block pop-ups. I also didn't know about clearing the cookies and website data from my MacBook. I'm not sure if this is only from my laptop, but I have to turn off the Cross-site tracking prevention button because it's not letting me see some of the assignments for my math class on Blackboard.  
      <br>
      How you envision being able to apply the concept to your own current or future environment: I can use these resources to improve how I use Safari on my laptop, manage data, and keep my information safe. In my own opinion, I think Safari is a safe browser for its many qualities in privacy.  </p>

    <h2>Assignment 2 - Activity 5 Summary</h2>
    <p>
      Wikiversity Activity Name: Configure browser extensions and add-ons.
      <br>
      The topic you are describing: How to enable Plug-ins, and to deactivate or remove browser extensions.
      <br>
      What you learned about the topic: I discovered that there are many extensions for my laptop browser and that it can help me more with blocking advertisements and I can have a grammar-check extension installed so that I can make some corrections as I type out all my work. 
      <br>
      How you envision being able to apply the concept to your own current or future environment: I can install Grammarly to my browser and I can make corrections for any future assignments for college and any reports I can make when I have a job that may include typing reports.   </p>
