    <h1>Assignment 3 - Activity 2 Summary</h1>
    <p>
      Wikiversity Activity Name: Compare each search engine.
      <br>  
      The topic I am describing: I've used Google as my preferred search engine to look for the market shares for each search engine.    
      <br>  
      What I learned about the topic: I discovered that out of six different search engines worldwide based on information from StatCounter Global Stats as of December of 2024, Google has 89.73 percent in market shares, while the other five search engines are between 4 or below 1 percent in that order. I believe it's because Google has the best interface for those who use Google, and it has a spotless and accurate search engine. I did notice that the other search engines have similar features with Bing prioritizing image search and DuckDuckGo gives users some privacy by not having a search history.
      <br>
      How do I envision being able to apply the concept to my own current or future environment: I could perhaps experiment with Bing and DuckDuckGo and see if I want to switch from Google to one of these search engines, or just continue with the one that I currently use.  </p>

    <h2>Assignment 3 - Activity 4 Summary</h2>
    <p>
      Wikiversity Activity Name: Learning about what Search Engine Optimization is.
      <br>
      The topic I am describing: I am adding a web page to Google's search engine.
      <br>
      What I learned about the topic: Search Engine Optimization or "SEO" is designed to improve what you search for on the internet by making your queries show more visible results. You can also find the website faster by having a saved copy of a URL from a web page and pasting it to your preferred search engine. I used the URL from a Wikiversity website and a website from an item on Amazon as an example.
      <br>
      How do I envision being able to apply the concept to my own current or future environment: Perhaps I can review websites I searched for in the past and see if they rank at the top of my search and see how much traffic some of these websites received. </p>
