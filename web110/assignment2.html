    <p>
      Wikiversity Activity Name: Configuring the browser settings. 
      <br>  
      The topic you are describing: Review available resources for Safari and check Safari preferences and/or modify any settings that would improve my experience on using the browser. 
      <br>  
      What you learned about the topic: I learned about the six resources on the Apple Support website. I already knew about the search history and the privacy report resources, but I didn't know much about the option to block pop-ups. Of course, I have to turn off the Cross-site tracking prevention button because it's not letting me see some of the assignments for my math class in Blackboard.
