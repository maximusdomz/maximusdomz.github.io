    <p>Assignment 1b - 
      Wikiversity Activity Name: WikiHow tutorials (saving files) 
      The topic you are describing: This topic is about how to organize a folder from your Windows or Mac computer. 
      What you learned about the topic: What I learned is on Windows, in 5 steps on making a storage folder for the files. First, you have to click on the file to select and press the SHIFT button so that you can select a second file while you still have the first file selected. Next, you can choose an existing folder or create a folder of your own with a name of your own choosing. After this, you can create subfolders to organize your files inside the main folder you have. Lastly, you have to have Windows backup to make copies of your folders into another hard drive or in a server in the event the hard drive on the computer fails. The instructions for the Mac version is similar, except there are some differences from Windows, such as the Time Machine app and after selecting the files, use the Control and Click buttons on the files to make a new folder with the selected files.  
      How you envision being able to apply the concept to your own current or future environment: Since I have a MacBook Pro, I knew how to make a folder but the majority of them are messy and they require some corrections so that I can find the right file in the right folder. It's better to be organized in the Finder app as well as the Desktop screen, otherwise the files are all over the place. </p>
